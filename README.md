cc-scripts
==========

A collection of ComputerCraft scripts.

The goal of this project is to create and maintain a collection of well
assembled and thoughtfully documented Lua scripts for use within the excellent
[ComputerCraft](http://computercraft.info/wiki/Main_Page) mod for
[Minecraft](https://minecraft.net/).

Installation
============

1. Open the Lua interpreter on your in-game computer: `lua`

2. Ensure your server has the HTTP API enabled. You can test it with this code snippet:
   `assert(http, "No HTTP for you!")`  
   __If your server doesn't have the HTTP API enabled, have an admin check the ComputerCraft configuration files and enable it from there.__

3. Enter the following snippet to download the installation:
`loadstring(http.get("https://raw.github.com/cc-scripts/cc-scripts/master/bootstrap.lua").readAll())(exit)`

4. Follow the instructions given by the installer and you should be good to go!
